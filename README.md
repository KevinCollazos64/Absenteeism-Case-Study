Preprocessed and applied a logistic regression on a sample employee dataset from 365 data science in attempts to predict employee excessive absenteeism ( > 3 hours away from the workplace) based on a variety of features.
Relevant features were extracted and some new ones engineered.
All visualizations were made on Tableau and interactive versions can be found in my Tableau public profile https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kevin.collazos/vizzes
